Pediatric Sepsis Risk Tool

🧠 Purpose

This project is a proof-of-concept bedside decision support tool designed to help clinicians rapidly assess pediatric sepsis risk at the point of care.

It was created as an experiment to explore how a non-programmer pediatric intensivist could use ChatGPT to build a working web app in approximately one hour. The goal was to test how AI tools can empower clinicians to independently prototype useful applications for bedside care.
