Pediatric Sepsis Risk Tool

🧠 Purpose
This project is a proof-of-concept bedside decision support tool designed to help clinicians rapidly assess pediatric sepsis risk at the point of care.

It began as an experiment to explore how a non-programmer Pediatric Intensivist could use ChatGPT to build a working web app in approximately one hour. The goal was to test how AI tools can empower clinicians to independently prototype useful applications for bedside care. After numerous revisions, and additional hours, the current tool incorporates Phoenix Criteria, SIRS (aka Goldstein) Criteria), and LPCH Sepsis Pathway Criteria.
